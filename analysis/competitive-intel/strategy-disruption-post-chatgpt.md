## Executive Summary
The traditional strategy consulting model (McKinsey, BCG, Bain) faces existential disruption from AI automation, creating unprecedented opportunities for HERO's implementation-focused approach to capture the $500B+ global strategy market.

## The Great Strategy Consulting Disruption

### Pre-ChatGPT Model (2010-2022)
**Revenue Foundation**: Junior analyst armies producing research and slides
- **Pyramid Structure**: 1 Partner, 3 Principals, 8 Associates, 24 Analysts
- **Core Value**: Information synthesis and presentation
- **Billing Model**: $300-800/hour for analyst time
- **Deliverable**: Strategic recommendations (PowerPoint)
- **Implementation**: "Not our problem" (separate engagement)

### Post-ChatGPT Reality (2024+)
**AI Replacement of Core Functions**:
- **Research**: ChatGPT/Claude replace 80% of analyst work
- **Data Analysis**: AI tools process market data in minutes vs weeks
- **Slide Creation**: AI generates professional presentations instantly

- **6-12 Month Engagements**: For what AI can do in hours
- **Theory-Only Delivery**: No implementation capability
- **Premium Pricing**: $500K-1.25M for strategic studies

**HERO Disruption Strategy**:

- **Value Creation Plans**: Template-based, now AI-generated
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Algorithmic vs consultant-driven

**HERO Disruption Strategy**:
- **PE Partner Program**: Rapid due diligence + immediate value creation

- **Engagement Duration**: 75% reduction (6 months → 6 weeks)
- **Cost Structure**: 50-60% margin compression
- **Client Expectations**: Implementation required, not just recommendations
- **Competitive Advantage**: Technology capability vs network/brand

### New Market Dynamics
**Winners**: Implementation-focused, AI-native consultancies
**Losers**: Research-heavy, presentation-focused traditional firms
**Growth Opportunity**: $500B strategy market × 70% disruption = $350B available

## HERO's Strategy Market Opportunity
